## IndexifyButBetter

This Project has 3 main features

- Allows you to insert, update, and delete index files. This will automatically adjust imports, adjust export proxies, and handle naming conflicts. Unnecessary exports will not be included in the index files.
- Allows you quickly see a folder's "public interface" by seeing references into and out of the folder. This is an alternative to maintaining actual index files.
- Allows you to see a readout of the unused exports inside a folder.
